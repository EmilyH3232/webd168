    <h1>All about Rabbits</h1>
    <p>Rabbits are the most adorable animals in the world.</p>
    <p>I used to own rabbits, until they died.</p>

    <p>Here's my favorite song about rabbits:</p>
    <p>
      Little bunny Foo Foo<br />
      Hopping through the forest<br />
      Scooping up the field mice<br />
      And bopping them on the head<br />
      Down came the Good Fairy, and she said<br />
      "Little bunny Foo Foo<br />
      I don't want to see you<br />
      Scooping up the field mice<br />
      And bopping them on the head."
    </p>

    <p>Reasons that rabbits make <em>great</em> pets:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Furry</li>
      <li><strong>Great listeners!</strong></li>
      <li>They eat your extra carrots</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Most famous rabbits:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Bugs Bunny</li>
      <li>Rabbit in the hat</li>
    </ol>

    <p>My favorite kind of rabbit is a dwarf lop:</p>
