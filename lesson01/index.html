    Hello! My name is Emily Huang, and I’m currently exploring the exciting world of web development. I love creating things from scratch and watching ideas come to life in the browser. This webpage is my introduction to HTML and CSS!
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m especially interested in front-end development because it combines creativity with logic. I enjoy the challenge of making websites that not only work well but also look beautiful and feel intuitive. Design, color, layout — it all fascinates me!
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of coding, I’m a big fan of baking and painting. I believe creativity in one area inspires growth in others. This journey into web development is just the beginning, and I’m excited to keep learning and building more complex projects.
